The `jagstargets` R package is an extension to [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) and [`rjags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjags) for Bayesian data analysis. `jagstargets` makes it super easy to set up useful scalable JAGS pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date. Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually configure branching, so usage is much easier than [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) alone.

## Installation

Install the GitHub development version to access the latest features and patches.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wlandau/jagstargets")
```

And if you have not done so already, install JAGS from <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>.

## Documentation

The `jagstargets` website at <https://wlandau.github.io/jagstargets/> has function documentation and vignettes. Prior familiarity with [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) and [`rjags`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjags) is highly recommended. For [`targets`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets), you can learn more at <https://wlandau.github.io/targets>. The JAGS user manual is linked from <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/>.
