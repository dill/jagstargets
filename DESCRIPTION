Package: jagstargets
Title: Targets for JAGS Workflows
Description: The 'jagstargets' R package is an extension to
  'targets' and 'R2jags' for Bayesian data analysis.
  'jagstargets' makes it super easy to set up useful scalable
  JAGS pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation
  and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date.
  Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually
  configure branching, so usage is much easier than 'targets' alone.
  For the underlying methodology, please refer
  to the documentation of 'targets'
  (Landau 2021) <https://github.com/wlandau/targets> and 'JAGS'
  (Plummer 2003) <https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2003/Proceedings/Plummer.pdf>.
